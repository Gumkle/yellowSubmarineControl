### Idea
For local development it's better and faster to use Docker, but for prod we can consider
not using it and using standalone services instead. GUI will be displayed in web browser
for the sake of simplicity.  

### Local development

#### Requirements
- Docker, 
- Docker-compose

#### Running app
- run `docker-compose up` in terminal in project folder
