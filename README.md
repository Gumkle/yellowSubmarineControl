### Idea
For local development it's better and faster to use Docker, but for prod we can consider
not using it and using standalone services instead. GUI will be displayed in web browser
for the sake of simplicity. Minimum screen resolution is 1366x768, preferably larger, best
at 1920x1080. No plans for maintaining lower ones. 16:9 works best.  

### Local development
#### Requirements
- Docker, 
- Docker-compose

#### Running app
- run `docker-compose up` in terminal in project folder
